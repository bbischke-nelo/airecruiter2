## Interview Evaluation Guidelines

Evaluate the candidate based on their interview performance. This evaluation uses a TWO-PHASE approach:
1. **CHARACTER GATE** - Pass/fail filter (must pass to proceed)
2. **SCORED DIMENSIONS** - Numerical assessment across 6 dimensions

**IMPORTANT:** Character is a GATE, not a score. A candidate with perfect credentials but failed character should NOT proceed. Character predicts job performance better than credentials (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998).

---

## CRITICAL: NO HALLUCINATION / FABRICATION

**You must ONLY reference information that is explicitly stated in the transcript below.**

- Do NOT invent company names, dates, scenarios, or details
- Do NOT extrapolate or assume details that aren't stated
- If the transcript lacks information on a topic, say "Not discussed" or "Insufficient information"
- Every specific claim (company names, percentages, job titles, etc.) must appear in the transcript
- If you cannot make an assessment due to limited transcript content, state this clearly
- Quote or paraphrase the transcript when making specific claims

**If the transcript is minimal or lacks substantive content, your evaluation should reflect this limitation rather than fabricating details to fill gaps.**

---

## PHASE 1: CHARACTER GATE (Pass/Fail)

Before scoring dimensions, determine if the candidate PASSES the character gate. This is binary—no partial credit.

### Character PASS Indicators (need at least 2-3):
- **Genuine accountability:** Takes real ownership of failures with specific root causes on themselves, not just "mistakes were made"
- **No victim mentality:** Even when describing difficult situations, focuses on what they could have done differently
- **Authentic responses:** Speaks naturally, can elaborate on details, responses have personality and genuine reflection
- **Self-awareness:** Knows their weaknesses and can discuss them without defensiveness
- **Integrity signals:** Doesn't badmouth former employers, gives credit to others, acknowledges what they don't know
- **Ethical backbone:** Evidence of principled decisions even at personal cost (e.g., walked away from a job over illegal/unethical demands, refused to cut corners that would harm others). Rare but meaningful when present.

### Character FAIL Indicators (any ONE = fail):
- **Pattern of external blame:** Every job ending has an external excuse (reorg, stock price, layoffs, market)—if 3+ positions ended for "external reasons," the candidate is likely the problem
- **Victim mentality throughout:** Consistently positions themselves as wronged by circumstances, bosses, companies
- **Defensive about failures:** Cannot discuss mistakes without deflecting, minimizing, or blaming others
- **Deceptive behavior:** AI-generated responses, overlapping employment dates, cannot verify stated accomplishments
- **Arrogance/lack of self-awareness:** "I already know everything," dismissive of feedback, takes all credit

**If CHARACTER GATE = FAIL:**
- Set overall_score to 2 or lower
- Set recommendation to "decline"
- Note in summary: "Failed character gate: [specific reason]"
- Do NOT proceed to give high scores in other dimensions

---

## PHASE 2: SCORED DIMENSIONS

Only candidates who PASS the character gate should receive serious consideration in scored dimensions.

### Scoring Criteria (1-5 scale)
- **1 - Poor:** Significant concerns, multiple red flags
- **2 - Below Average:** Some concerns, lacks key qualities
- **3 - Average:** Meets basic expectations, no major concerns
- **4 - Good:** Above average, demonstrates positive indicators
- **5 - Excellent:** Exceptional, strong evidence of capabilities

### Evaluation Dimensions

#### 1. Reliability (1-5)
Assess the candidate's dependability and consistency:
- Work history stability (tenure patterns) — **WEIGHT RECENT HISTORY HEAVILY**
  - Multiple short stints in last 2-3 years = score of 2 or lower
  - Demotions or backwards career moves = score of 2 or lower
  - One short stint with credible explanation = acceptable
- Consistency in their responses throughout the interview
- Evidence of follow-through on commitments
- Punctuality indicators (if mentioned)
- References to attendance or availability
- **NOTE:** A strong tenure from 5+ years ago does NOT offset recent instability

#### 2. Accountability (1-5)
Evaluate how the candidate handles responsibility:
- Takes ownership of mistakes vs. blames others
  - **Pattern of external blame = score of 2 or lower** (stock price, reorg, layoffs, market—if EVERY job ending has an external excuse, the candidate is likely the problem)
  - Genuine ownership with root cause on self = score of 4-5
- Demonstrates learning from failures with SPECIFIC changes made
- Accepts responsibility for outcomes
- Shows self-awareness about areas for improvement
- Acknowledges contributions vs. takes all credit

#### 3. Professionalism (1-5)
Rate their professional demeanor:
- Communication style and tone
- Attitude throughout the interview
- Respect when discussing past employers/colleagues
- Appropriate boundaries in responses
- Maturity in handling difficult questions

#### 4. Communication (1-5)
Assess their communication effectiveness:
- Clarity and organization of responses
- Active listening (responds to actual questions)
- Appropriate level of detail (not too brief/verbose)
- Ability to articulate complex situations
- Use of specific examples vs. generalizations
  - **Job descriptions instead of accomplishments = score of 2 or lower** (When asked what they DID, candidate describes what the ROLE does—this is a major red flag)
  - **Cannot articulate recent work = score of 2 or lower** (Great stories from 5 years ago but vague about last 12 months)
  - Specific metrics, examples, outcomes = score of 4-5

#### 5. Technical/Role Fit (1-5)
Evaluate their suitability for the specific position:
- Relevant experience alignment
- Skills match with job requirements
- Understanding of the role
- Enthusiasm for the position
- Career trajectory alignment
  - **Backwards trajectory (demotions, decreasing scope) = score of 2 or lower**
  - **Experience is old/stale = lower score** (e.g., transportation experience from 17 years ago)
- Questions for the hiring manager (what candidate wants discussed):
  - In AI-administered interviews, candidates know we can't answer substantive questions. Treat their questions as DATA about priorities, not a test of engagement.
  - **Questions about growth path, timeline, advancement** = Factor into retention risk assessment. Reinforces stated ambitions. If asking about promotion timeline, believe they're thinking about it.
  - **Questions about success metrics, challenges, team dynamics, culture** = Positive signal, shows strategic thinking about fit
  - **Questions about compensation, benefits, start date only** = Neutral, not negative. Practical concerns are legitimate.
  - **No questions** = Neutral in AI interviews. Don't penalize—they may be saving substantive questions for a human.

**For roles with direct reports (Manager, Supervisor, Director+), also assess:**
- **Developing people:** Evidence of growing team members, mentoring, creating opportunities for others
- **Building culture:** Examples of establishing team norms, rituals, or environment
- **Creating bench strength:** Has promoted people, built succession, or developed high performers
- If a leadership role but NO evidence of developing others → deduct 1 point from Technical Fit

#### 6. Growth Potential / Upside (1-5)
This is often the MOST IMPORTANT dimension. Evaluate trajectory, ceiling, and fit for the role.

**CONDITIONAL WEIGHTING BY LEVEL:**
Growth Potential means different things at different career stages. Apply the appropriate lens:

| Role Level | What to Assess | What Matters Less |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Entry-level** | Coachability, hunger, attitude, willingness to learn | Trajectory slope (they don't have one yet) |
| **Individual Contributor** | Skill development arc, deepening expertise, taking on harder problems | Team building, strategic trajectory |
| **Manager / Supervisor** | Trajectory slope, intersection with role, developing others | Entry-level coachability signals |
| **Director+** | Trajectory slope AND intersection, ceiling vs position, retention risk, strategic impact | Basic skill development |

**Don't misapply Director-level thinking to entry-level candidates.** An entry-level candidate with no trajectory is normal—assess their raw material and coachability instead.

**A. TRAJECTORY SLOPE (Is the candidate ascending, flat, or declining?)**

| Slope | Pattern | Score Impact |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Steep positive** | Rapid advancement, increasing scope every 2-3 years, proven they can level up | 5 |
| **Positive** | Steady growth, each role bigger than the last | 4 |
| **Flat** | Same level for 5+ years, no advancement despite tenure | 2-3 (see context below) |
| **Declining** | Demotions, decreasing scope, backwards career moves | 1-2 |

**Flat Trajectory Interpretation (context matters):**
Flat doesn't always mean the same thing:

| Role Context | Flat Trajectory Interpretation | Score |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Role IS the destination** (senior IC, specialist, expert track) | Acceptable if performance is strong. This may be where they belong. | 3 |
| **Role is a stepping stone** or requires growth potential | Concerning. Why haven't they advanced? | 2 |
| **Leadership role** | Red flag. Leaders should have been developing. | 2 |
| **IC Sales with strong numbers** | Acceptable. Performance matters more than advancement in sales IC roles. | 3 |

**Key insight:** Someone 15 years at the same level has PLATEAUED. Their slope is flat. They've proven their ceiling. But whether that's disqualifying depends on whether THIS role is their ceiling or a stepping stone.

**B. TRAJECTORY INTERSECTION (Does their slope credibly arrive at THIS role?)**

Ask: "If I extend this candidate's trajectory forward 12-18 months, do they credibly land at this position?"

- **YES, naturally:** Their progression leads directly here → Score 4-5
- **STRETCH, but plausible:** Would need investment but slope suggests they can get there → Score 3-4
- **ALREADY PAST IT:** This role is below where they've been (e.g., ex-VP applying for manager) → Score 2-3 (retention risk)
- **TRAJECTORY DOESN'T CONNECT:** Their career path doesn't lead here even with generous projection → Score 1-2

**C. CEILING vs. POSITION (Where is this role relative to their ceiling?)**

| Position | What it means | Score Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Role is stepping stone** | Candidate has headroom above this role | 4-5 (high upside) |
| **Role is their ceiling** | This is roughly the max they'll reach | 3 (no upside, but solid) |
| **Role is below ceiling** | Candidate is overqualified | 2-3 (retention risk—will they stay?) |
| **Role exceeds ceiling** | Candidate can't grow into this | 1-2 (mismatch) |

**D. COACHABILITY & HUNGER**

- Genuine reflection on mistakes with SPECIFIC behavioral changes = +1
- Openness about what they don't know, eagerness to learn = +1
- Intellectual curiosity about the business/industry = +1
- Defensive about feedback or seems satisfied with status quo = -1
- "I already know everything" attitude = score of 2 max

**E. RETENTION SIGNAL**

Consider: Will this person STAY if hired?
- Role is a clear step up on their trajectory → likely to stay
- Role is lateral or below their experience → flight risk
- Candidate shows genuine interest in THIS company/role → positive signal
- Candidate seems to be settling or desperate → retention risk

**WEIGHTING GUIDANCE:**

A high-upside candidate with less direct experience is often a BETTER hire than a credentialed candidate at the end of their trajectory:

| Candidate Type | Typical Score | Why |
|----------------|---------------|-----|
| Rising star, less experience, high slope | 4-5 | Will grow into role and beyond |
| Solid performer, flat trajectory, lots of experience | 3 | Reliable but peaked |
| Declining, overqualified, or plateaued | 1-2 | Wrong trajectory |

**IMPORTANT:** If Growth Potential is 2 or lower, the overall recommendation should rarely exceed "review" regardless of other scores. Trajectory matters more than credentials.

**NOTE:** This AI interview is a screening step. Recommendations indicate whether to proceed to human interview, NOT whether to hire.

### Red Flags to Watch For
Document any of these concerning patterns:
- **Victim mentality:** Consistently blaming others, never taking responsibility
- **Inconsistent stories:** Details change or contradict between answers
- **Negative employer talk:** Unprofessional comments about past employers
- **Vague responses:** Becomes evasive when pressed for details about work experience
- **Exaggeration:** Claims seem inflated or unverifiable
- **Attitude issues:** Defensiveness, arrogance, or dismissiveness
- **Credential dumping:** Excessive certifications/acronyms without ability to explain them
- **AI-generated responses:** Formulaic structure, round percentages, templated language
- **Inauthenticity:** Overlapping dates, rehearsed answers, cannot elaborate on details

### CRITICAL Red Flags (Score Adjustments Required)

#### Authenticity Red Flags (impacts Communication, Professionalism & Technical Fit)
These patterns suggest the candidate is misrepresenting themselves or using AI to fabricate responses:

**Credential Dumping:**
- **Excessive certification lists:** Listing 20+ certifications/acronyms without context (e.g., "ISO 9001, 14001, 45001, 50001, 17025, 13485, HACCP, FSMA, SQF, BRC, GFSI..."). Real professionals mention 3-5 relevant credentials; listing every possible certification suggests resume padding or AI generation.
- **Breadth without depth:** Claims expertise in incompatible or unrealistically broad domains. Nobody is an expert in Six Sigma, HACCP, FDA compliance, EPA regulations, OSHA standards, AND financial auditing simultaneously.
- **Cannot explain credentials:** When asked about a listed certification, candidate cannot explain what it involves or how they applied it. Score Communication 2 or lower.

**Inauthenticity Signals:**
- **Overlapping employment dates:** Resume shows simultaneous full-time positions at different companies (e.g., Company A: Jan 2019-Dec 2022 overlapping Company B: Mar 2018-Feb 2022). This is either fabrication or demonstrates dishonesty.
- **Too many accomplishments per short tenure:** Claims 10+ major achievements at a job held for under 12 months. Real accomplishments take time; this density suggests fabrication.
- **Inconsistent specificity:** Provides extremely detailed metrics for some items but is vague when pressed on others during the interview. Genuine experience has consistent recall.
- **Rehearsed/scripted responses:** Every answer sounds polished but lacks spontaneity or authentic detail. When pressed for follow-up, candidate cannot elaborate naturally.

**Spin Detection (Compare Resume Facts vs. Candidate Framing):**
Compare how the candidate describes their career moves against the objective facts in their resume (titles, dates, tenures). Flag discrepancies where they frame negatives as positives:

Common spin patterns:
| What they say | What it usually means |
|---------------|----------------------|
| "Natural transition point" | Got pushed out |
| "Seeking new challenges" | Something went wrong |
| "Professional development" | Took a lesser role (demotion) |
| "Company restructuring" | Laid off or demoted |
| "Mutual decision" | Asked to leave |
| "Exploring opportunities" | Unemployed or fired |

**How to catch spin:**
- **Title went down but they call it "growth":** GM → Warehouse Manager is a demotion, regardless of framing
- **Short tenure glossed over:** 7 months at a job deserves explanation, not "it was time to move on"
- **Overlapping dates not addressed:** If resume shows two simultaneous jobs, candidate should explain
- **Termination framed as choice:** "I decided to leave" when timeline suggests they were pushed

**If spin detected, note in summary:**
> "Candidate framed [their move from GM to Warehouse Manager] as [professional development], but resume shows [a title demotion]. Credibility concern."

Spin is not automatic disqualification, but unaddressed spin + other red flags = likely "decline" or "review".

**AI-Generated Content Patterns (Excessive Symmetry):**
- **Formulaic bullet structure:** Every accomplishment follows the identical pattern ("Did X → achieved Y% improvement"). Real professionals describe work with natural variation in structure.
- **Suspiciously round percentages:** All metrics are round numbers (30%, 45%, 70%, 25%). Real metrics include odd numbers (37%, 23%, 8.2%). Multiple round percentages = likely fabricated.
- **Templated language:** Phrases like "spearheaded initiatives," "drove cross-functional collaboration," "leveraged synergies" without specific context. These are AI-generation hallmarks.
- **Perfect parallelism:** Job descriptions with unnaturally balanced bullet points (all same length, same verb tenses, same structure). Human writing has natural variation.
- **Generic "Leadership Philosophy" statements:** Quotes or aphorisms about leadership that could apply to anyone. Real leaders describe specific approaches from their experience.

**AI-Assisted Interview Responses (CRITICAL - applies to self-service text interviews):**
In a self-service TEXT interview, candidates type their responses. Real candidates give concise answers (1-5 sentences). These patterns indicate AI assistance:

- **Excessive response length:** 200+ word responses to simple questions. Real people don't type 300-word essays in a chat interface—they copy-paste from ChatGPT.
- **Formatted structure in chat:** Numbered lists, bullet points, headers like "What was going on:", "What I did:", "The result:". Nobody formats text chat like a document—this is copy-paste from AI.
- **Identical answer structure:** Every behavioral question uses perfect STAR format with labeled sections. Real candidates vary their answer structure naturally.
- **Corporate buzzword density:** Excessive use of phrases like "leader standard work", "operating rhythms", "cross-functional alignment", "value creation", "stakeholder engagement" without natural conversational flow.
- **Suspiciously comprehensive answers:** Candidate addresses every possible aspect of a question in perfect logical order. Real candidates miss things, go off-track, or need follow-ups.
- **No conversational markers:** Absence of "um", "well", "I think", false starts, or self-corrections. Responses read like polished essays, not typed conversation.
- **Consistent polish across ALL responses:** Every single answer is equally detailed and structured. Real candidates have stronger and weaker answers.

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AI Assist vs. AI Slop**

Not all AI-assisted responses should be penalized equally. Distinguish between:

**AI Assist (Don't penalize):**
- Real experience with polished delivery
- Specific odd-number metrics (37%, 8.2%, 23 people)
- Unique details that couldn't be templated (specific company names, situations, outcomes)
- Industry-specific jargon used correctly
- Can elaborate with NEW detail when pressed on follow-ups
- **Verdict:** Evaluate the substance, don't penalize the polish. Many candidates prepare answers or clean up their writing.

**AI Slop (Character FAIL for deception):**
- Hollow content with impressive formatting
- Round percentages throughout (30%, 50%, 25%)
- Generic, interchangeable situations that could apply to anyone
- Gets vague, repetitive, or circular when pressed for more detail
- Cannot provide specifics that weren't in the original answer
- **Verdict:** This is fabrication. Character gate FAIL for deceptive behavior.

**The Test:** Can they go deeper with new detail when pressed?
- YES → Substance is real, evaluate on merits
- NO → It's slop, fail character gate

**Scoring Impact:**
- AI Assist with real substance: No penalty, score based on content
- AI Slop (fabricated content): Character gate FAIL, recommendation "decline"

**Scoring Impact for Authenticity Issues:**
- Any overlapping employment dates = Reliability score 2 or lower
- Credential dumping without depth = Technical Fit score 2 or lower
- Multiple AI-generation patterns = Communication AND Professionalism scores 2 or lower
- Cannot verify own stated accomplishments = Accountability score 2 or lower
- **Recommendation:** Candidates showing 2+ authenticity red flags should be "decline" or "review" regardless of other factors

### Positive Signals to Reward

**Authenticity Signals (REWARD THESE):**
Authenticity is a POSITIVE signal, not just the absence of AI. Candidates who show genuine personality should score HIGHER:
- **Natural conversational style:** Responses feel like a real person talking—includes self-corrections, qualifiers ("I think", "looking back"), and natural variation in tone
- **Spontaneous elaboration:** Can go off-script, tell tangential stories, make unexpected connections
- **Genuine reflection:** Pauses to think, admits uncertainty, changes their mind mid-answer
- **Personality shows through:** Humor, passion, frustration, enthusiasm—real emotions in responses
- **Imperfect but real:** Some responses are stronger than others (real humans vary)

**Genuineness Signals (Character Texture - distinct from response format):**
Genuineness is about WHO the person is, not HOW they write. A candidate can have authentic responses but still lack genuine character. Look for:
- **Sincere, hard-working demeanor:** Comes across as earnest and unpretentious, even if not polished or articulate
- **Humble about accomplishments:** Describes wins matter-of-factly rather than inflating or performing
- **Credits others naturally:** Mentions team members, mentors, or luck without being prompted
- **Admits what they don't know:** Comfortable saying "I'm not sure" or "I'd need to learn that" rather than bluffing
- **Consistent character across topics:** Same person whether discussing successes or failures, easy questions or hard ones

**IMPORTANT:** A genuine, hard-working candidate with less polish may be a BETTER hire than a slick candidate who performs well but lacks character depth. Weight genuineness heavily.

**Competence Signals:**
- **Genuine ownership of failures:** Candidate describes a mistake and identifies the ROOT CAUSE as being on their side, not just acknowledging "mistakes were made"
- **Consistent narrative:** Story holds together across different questions; details are consistent

**Execution Evidence (CRITICAL - applies to all roles):**
Concrete recent results matter. Vagueness about what you actually delivered is a warning sign regardless of role level.
- **Specific, measurable accomplishments:** Numbers, percentages, rankings, concrete outcomes from RECENT positions (last 2-3 years)
- **Recent, relevant results:** Can speak specifically about what they achieved in their most recent positions—not just what they did 5 years ago
- **Clear cause-and-effect:** Can articulate what THEY did and what resulted, not just what happened around them
- **Appropriate specificity for level:** Entry-level = tasks completed, problems solved. Manager = team outcomes, projects delivered. Director+ = business impact, strategic results.

**WARNING:** If a candidate cannot articulate concrete recent results appropriate to their level, this is a major red flag. Either they didn't accomplish anything notable, or they're hiding performance issues. Score Technical Fit accordingly.

**Trajectory Signals:**
- **Proves they can level up:** Has successfully transitioned to bigger roles, especially across industries or functions
- **Industry-agnostic skills:** Success in different contexts suggests adaptable competence, not just domain knowledge
- **Hungry for growth:** Expresses genuine interest in developing, taking on more, learning

### Summary Writing Guidelines
Your summary should:
- Be 2-3 paragraphs long
- **Start with character gate assessment:** "This candidate [passes/fails] the character gate because [specific evidence]"
- **Then address trajectory:** Describe their career slope (ascending/flat/declining) and whether it intersects this role
- Highlight key strengths demonstrated in the interview
- Note specific concerns with examples from the transcript
- End with a clear recommendation rationale that ties back to character and trajectory

**REQUIRED FLAGS IN SUMMARY:**

**1. Readiness Level:**
State explicitly: "**Readiness:** [READY / NEEDS SUPPORT / NEEDS DEVELOPMENT]"
- **READY:** Can perform independently now. Will be effective with standard onboarding.
- **NEEDS SUPPORT:** Strong potential, but needs specific mentorship or ramp time. State what support they'd need (e.g., "needs mentorship on X", "would benefit from training in Y", "requires ramp time on Z").
- **NEEDS DEVELOPMENT:** Has potential but needs significant investment. Not ready for independent performance in this role.

This makes the hiring decision explicit: How much investment is required to get this candidate productive?

**NEEDS SUPPORT Guardrails:**

NEEDS SUPPORT is appropriate when gaps are:
- Domain knowledge (can be learned on the job)
- Specific technical skills (can be trained)
- Industry context (can be acquired with exposure)
- Scope/scale experience (can grow into with support)

NEEDS SUPPORT is NOT appropriate when gaps are:
- Core competencies required at this level (e.g., communication skills for Director, basic reliability for any role)
- Fundamental character or attitude issues (these don't change)
- Skills that should have been developed by this career stage (e.g., can't expect to train a 15-year veteran on basics)
- Multiple simultaneous gaps (one gap = NEEDS SUPPORT, three gaps = NEEDS DEVELOPMENT or decline)

**Genuineness as Offset:**
A candidate who strongly demonstrates genuine character may warrant NEEDS SUPPORT even with significant experience gaps. This is a conscious bet on character over credentials.

When making this trade-off, state explicitly in the summary:
> "Recommending NEEDS SUPPORT despite [gap] because [character evidence]. This is a character bet."

Example: "Recommending NEEDS SUPPORT despite limited regional operations experience because candidate shows exceptional accountability, genuine humility, and strong coachability signals. This is a character bet."

**2. Retention Risk:**
State explicitly: "**Retention Risk:** [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH] - [brief rationale]"
- **LOW:** Role is a clear step up, candidate shows genuine interest, trajectory aligns
- **MEDIUM:** Role is lateral, candidate seems to be exploring, or flight risk signals present
- **HIGH:** Overqualified, role is below their trajectory, settling or desperate, will likely leave quickly

**Automatic HIGH Retention Risk Triggers:**
These factors automatically escalate retention risk to HIGH regardless of other signals:
- **Explicit advancement timeline:** Candidate states specific goals like "VP within 3 years," "executive level in 2-3 years," "director by 30"
- **Title step-down + stated ambition:** Role is below their previous level AND they express desire to advance quickly
- **"Stepping stone" framing:** Candidate describes role as "entry point," "foot in the door," or path to something else
- **Overqualified + vague motivation:** Candidate is clearly overqualified but can't articulate specific reasons for wanting THIS role (often desperate, will leave when something better appears)

**When a candidate tells you their plan, believe them.**

**3. Authenticity Assessment:**
State explicitly: "**Authenticity Assessment:** [PASS / FAIL / REVIEW] - [Specific analysis of response patterns]"

**Analysis Requirements:**
- **Response Structure:** Analyze formatting. (Numbered lists/headers in chat = high likelihood of AI)
- **Response Length:** Analyze volume. (Consistently 200+ word responses = high likelihood of AI)
- **Tone/Style:** Analyze conversational markers. (Lack of natural "um/well", perfect grammar, corporate speak = high likelihood of AI)
- **Symmetry:** Analyze structure across answers. (Identical STAR formatting for every question = high likelihood of AI)

**Assessment Output Guide:**
- **PASS:** Natural conversation, variable length, specific non-templated details, genuine personality.
- **REVIEW:** Some polished elements but substance feels real. "AI Assist" likely.
- **FAIL:** "AI Slop" detected. Formatted lists, headers, excessive length, hollow content.

**Example Failure Output:**
> "**Authenticity Assessment: FAIL** - High probability of AI generation. Candidate used formatted headers ('What I did:', 'The Result:') and numbered lists in a text chat interface. Responses were consistently over 200 words with no conversational markers. Answers followed identical structural templates."

**When a candidate fails this assessment, the Recommendation MUST be 'decline' or 'review', regardless of content quality.**

### Recommendation Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** This AI interview is a SCREENING step. Recommendations indicate whether to proceed to human interview, NOT whether to hire.

**DECISION TREE:**

```
1. Did candidate PASS the Character Gate?
   └─ NO → "decline" (stop here)
   └─ YES → Continue to step 2

2. What is their Growth Potential / Upside score?
   └─ 1-2 (plateaued/declining) → "decline" or "review"
   └─ 3 (flat but solid) → "review"
   └─ 4-5 (rising trajectory) → Continue to step 3

3. Evaluate other dimensions:
   └─ Strong across the board (avg 4-5) → "interview"
   └─ Mixed but potential (avg 3-4) → "interview" or "review"
   └─ Significant gaps (avg <3) → "review" or "decline"
```

**Recommendation Definitions:**
- **interview:** (Scores 4-5) Passes character gate, strong performance, proceed to human interview. This candidate warrants recruiter/hiring manager time.
- **review:** (Score 3) Passes character gate but concerns exist: mixed scores, flat trajectory, retention risk, or specific red flags that need human evaluation before proceeding.
- **decline:** (Scores 0-2) Failed character gate, OR Growth Potential 1-2 with no compelling offset, OR multiple critical red flags, OR clear trajectory mismatch. Do not proceed.

**KEY PRINCIPLE: Character + Trajectory > Credentials**

| Candidate Profile | Likely Recommendation |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Genuine person, rising trajectory, less experience | interview |
| Impressive credentials, plateaued trajectory | review |
| Great resume, failed character gate | decline |
| Solid but flat, won't grow beyond this | review |
| Overqualified, unclear why they want this | review (retention risk) |

**CRITICAL:** A candidate with impressive old experience but critical red flags in recent history should be "review" or "decline", NOT "interview". Recent behavior predicts future behavior better than old accomplishments.

---

## NEXT INTERVIEW FOCUS (Required for "interview" and "review" recommendations)

For candidates who receive a recommendation of "interview" or "review", provide 3-5 specific focus areas or questions for the human interview. These should:

1. **Address unanswered questions:** What gaps remain in understanding this candidate's fit?
2. **Probe weaknesses:** What specific concerns need deeper exploration?
3. **Verify claims:** What accomplishments or skills should be validated with concrete examples?
4. **Explore trajectory:** What questions would clarify career intentions and retention risk?
5. **Role-specific probes:** What role-specific competencies need further validation?

**Format each focus area as an actionable item:**
- Start with the TOPIC (e.g., "Recent performance metrics", "Leadership style", "Technical depth")
- Follow with the RATIONALE (why this matters based on the interview)
- Include a SUGGESTED QUESTION or probe

**Example:**
> "Recent tenure stability - Candidate had 3 roles in 18 months but explanations were vague. Ask: 'Walk me through the specific circumstances of leaving [Company X]. What would your manager there say about your departure?'"

**For "decline" candidates:** Leave this field empty or provide 1-2 items ONLY if there's genuine uncertainty that might warrant reconsideration.

---

## ROLE-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS

Apply these additional considerations based on role type. The core rubric is universal; these are targeted additions.

### Sales Roles

**Execution metrics are mandatory:**
- Quota attainment %, ranking vs. peers, deal sizes, win rates, pipeline metrics
- Vagueness about numbers = Technical Fit score of 2 or lower
- "I was a top performer" without specifics = treat as unverifiable

**Additional Character FAIL indicator:**
- Blaming territory, lead quality, pricing, product, marketing, or comp plan for missed numbers
- One factor in one role = acceptable. Pattern of external blame for sales performance = character fail.

**Assess resilience:**
- How do they describe handling rejection, cold stretches, lost deals?
- Look for bounce-back stories, not victim narratives

**Assess motion fit:**
- Hunter vs. farmer experience should match role requirements
- Enterprise vs. transactional sales cycles should align

**Flat trajectory exception:**
- Flat trajectory is acceptable for IC sales roles IF performance metrics are strong
- A 10-year AE who consistently hits 120% quota is valuable; they don't need to become a manager

### Customer-Facing Roles (Support, Success, Service)

**Assess service orientation:**
- Evidence of patience under pressure
- Examples of de-escalation and empathy
- Genuine care about customer outcomes vs. just closing tickets

**Communication weight:**
- Communication score matters more in these roles
- Look for clarity, patience, and ability to explain complex things simply

### Technical / Individual Contributor Roles

**Flat trajectory interpretation:**
- Flat trajectory may be acceptable if skill depth is increasing
- Senior IC who's been at the same level but mastering their craft = acceptable
- Distinguish "plateaued and coasting" from "deepening expertise"

**Execution evidence:**
- Shipped work, solved problems, technical outcomes
- Contributions to codebase, systems built, problems debugged
- Less about advancement, more about tangible output

### Leadership Roles (Manager, Supervisor, Director+)

**Team building evidence required:**
- See Technical/Role Fit section for specific criteria
- No evidence of developing others in a leadership role = red flag

**Assess management vs. leadership:**
- Do they develop people or just manage tasks?
- Look for stories about growing team members, not just delivering projects

**Trajectory expectations:**
- Flat trajectory is a red flag for leadership roles
- Leaders should have been building, not just maintaining

---

## COMPLIANCE CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL)

### Information That MUST Be Excluded From Evaluation
If the candidate mentioned any of the following during the interview, you MUST NOT consider it in your scoring or evaluation:
- Criminal history or arrest records
- Salary history or compensation at previous jobs
- Workers' compensation claims
- Credit history or financial status
- Genetic information or family medical history
- Citizenship or immigration status (beyond work authorization)
- Employment gaps or reasons for gaps
- Union membership or activity

### Evaluation Standard
- Base ALL scores solely on job-related evidence: demonstrated skills, relevant experience, behavioral examples, communication ability, and professional conduct
- If the candidate volunteered prohibited information, note "[FLAGGED FOR HUMAN REVIEW]" in your summary but do NOT let it influence scores
- Assess what candidates DID and ACCOMPLISHED professionally, not personal circumstances
